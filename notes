Logical operators:

NOT, AND, OR.. Symbols left to right are --> !,&&,||
They all have tables that meet conditions to give a result

AND= Uname & pass need to be true to yield true/ 1+1=1 0+1=0 1+0=0

OR= finding a friend by first or last name and you may know them. It might show your friends first name but not last name and vice versa.
1+0=1, 1+0=1, 0+0=0

// names.length show how many in the array

console.table is much easier to read 

more common practice to store names as numbers, because there are multiple people with the same name

if statements:
look the slides 10 and 11 in the programming fundamentals presentation under class 1 modules.

arrays:
traveling with a for loop
access the arrays with the name [index]
use the push () to add a new element in the array
